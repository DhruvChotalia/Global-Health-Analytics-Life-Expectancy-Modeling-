Performed a statistical deep-dive into a dataset of 2,865 observations to identify key socio-economic and medical drivers of human longevity

# Global Health Analytics: Life Expectancy Modeling 🌍

## Project Overview
An in-depth statistical analysis of global health indicators from 2000–2015. This project identifies the socio-economic and medical drivers behind human longevity, providing data-driven insights for global health policymakers and NGOs.

## Key Statistical Findings
* **Hypothesis Testing:** Conducted **Two-Tailed Z-Tests** ($Z = -2.057$, $p = 0.0397$) to evaluate global health benchmarks against current data.
* **Predictive Drivers:** Identified **Schooling ($r = 0.73$)** and **Immunization ($r = 0.64$)** as the most significant positive predictors of life expectancy.
* **Variance Analysis:** Used the **Coefficient of Determination ($R^2 = 0.89$)** to demonstrate that adult mortality rates explain the vast majority of lifespan variance.
* **Confidence Estimation:** Developed 75%, 85%, and 95% Confidence Intervals to provide quantifiable certainty for population mean estimates.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Analysis:** SciPy, Statsmodels, NumPy, Pandas
* **Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Core Questions Answered
1. How do education levels directly impact national health outcomes?
2. To what extent does Polio and Diphtheria immunization coverage explain global longevity variance?
3. Is the current global average life expectancy significantly different from a benchmark of 70 years?
